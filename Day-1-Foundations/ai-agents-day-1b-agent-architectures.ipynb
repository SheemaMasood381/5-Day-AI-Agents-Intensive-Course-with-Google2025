    "\n",
    "**Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Agents course!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, you built a **single agent** that could take action. Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

    "> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n",

      "Are you tired of wrestling with complex software projects that feel like a tangled mess? Imagine a world where your development process is streamlined, more efficient, and even a little bit smarter. Welcome to the era of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a revolutionary approach that's quietly transforming how we build software.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what exactly are MAS? Think of them as a team of specialized \"agents,\" each with its own purpose, intelligence, and ability to communicate and cooperate. This is a powerful shift from traditional monolithic architectures. The power of specialization shines here; each agent handles specific tasks, leading to cleaner code, easier debugging, and improved maintainability. It’s like having a team of experts rather than one overwhelmed generalist. Plus, MAS can operate in a distributed manner, meaning if one agent encounters an issue, the others can often pick up the slack, leading to more robust and fault-tolerant systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do MAS supercharge development efficiency? Different teams can work on individual agents concurrently, significantly speeding up development cycles. MAS can also automate repetitive tasks, freeing up developers for more creative problem-solving. Agents can be programmed to communicate and coordinate, mimicking human teamwork, which translates to better internal communication and seamless integration of components. This modular design also encourages reusability, making it easier to upgrade functionalities without affecting the entire system.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAS also tackle complexity and scalability head-on. For large applications, breaking down functionality into independent, communicating agents makes the overall system far more manageable. These systems are adaptable and flexible, able to evolve with changing requirements by modifying or adding agents, making your software more future-proof. With AI capabilities, agents can make intelligent decisions and learn, leading to dynamic and responsive applications.\n",

      "\n",
      "Think of MAS as a collaborative team of specialized \"agents,\" each equipped with its own purpose, intelligence, and the ability to communicate and cooperate. This represents a significant departure from traditional monolithic architectures. The brilliance of MAS lies in its specialization: each agent is designed to handle specific tasks. This results in cleaner code, simpler debugging, and significantly improved maintainability. Instead of a single, overwhelmed generalist, you have a team of experts, each excelling in their domain. Furthermore, MAS can operate in a distributed manner. This means if one agent encounters an issue, others can often compensate, leading to more robust and fault-tolerant systems.\n",

      "How do MAS truly supercharge development efficiency? By allowing different teams to work on individual agents concurrently, MAS dramatically speeds up development cycles. They also excel at automating repetitive tasks, freeing up valuable developer time for more creative problem-solving and innovation. Agents can be programmed to communicate and coordinate their efforts, mirroring effective human teamwork. This translates directly to better internal communication within development teams and more seamless integration of different software components. The inherent modular design of MAS also encourages reusability, making it far easier to upgrade specific functionalities or reuse agents across projects without impacting the entire system.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tackling Complexity and Scalability Head-On\n",
      "\n",
      "MAS are particularly adept at managing complexity and scaling effectively. For large, intricate applications, breaking down functionality into independent, communicating agents makes the overall system far more manageable and understandable. These systems are inherently adaptable and flexible. They can evolve with changing requirements by simply modifying existing agents or adding new ones, ensuring your software remains future-proof. When imbued with AI capabilities, agents can make intelligent decisions and learn from their interactions, paving the way for dynamic and highly responsive applications.\n",

      "InitialWriterAgent > Elias had polished the great lens for thirty years, the rhythmic scrape of his cloth a familiar lullaby against the roar of the sea. Tonight, however, the usual monotony was broken. Tucked beneath a loose floorboard in his cramped quarters, a rolled parchment pulsed with an ethereal, bioluminescent light. Unfurling it, Elias found not nautical charts, but an intricate, star-dusted map. Islands, unseen on any Admiralty chart, swirled in nebulae of emerald and sapphire. Strange constellations, alien and beautiful, arced overhead. A single, shimmering X marked a spot deep within an uncharted archipelago. Elias, his heart thrumming with a long-forgotten sense of adventure, stared at the impossible map, the lighthouse beam a mere candle against its cosmic glow.\n",
      "CriticAgent > The story presents a compelling hook with Elias's discovery of the glowing map. The imagery of the \"star-dusted map\" and the \"nebulae of emerald and sapphire\" is evocative and sparks curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deepen Elias's characterization before the discovery:** While his thirty years of polishing the lens establish a sense of routine and potential monotony, giving the reader a slightly deeper glimpse into Elias's personality, his dreams (or lack thereof), or his feelings about his solitary life would make his \"long-forgotten sense of adventure\" feel more impactful. For example, a brief internal thought about his life's predictability, or a fleeting memory of a youthful yearning for something more, could enhance the contrast.\n",
      "2.  **Enhance the description of the map's discovery:** The \"loose floorboard\" is a classic trope, and while functional, could be made more specific to Elias's environment or routine. Was it a board he'd never noticed before, or one he *always* meant to fix? The \"ethereal, bioluminescent light\" is great, but perhaps a subtle detail about *why* it was hidden or how it remained concealed for so long could add another layer of mystery.\n",
      "3.  **Introduce a hint of immediate consequence or decision:** The story ends with Elias staring at the map. To create more narrative drive, consider adding a sentence that suggests his next step or a dawning realization of what this discovery truly means. Does he feel fear alongside adventure? Does he immediately begin to question the nature of his reality, or does he feel an irresistible pull to act? For instance, adding something like, \"The world beyond his lonely tower had suddenly expanded, and a terrifying, exhilarating choice presented itself.\"\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias had polished the great lens for thirty years, the rhythmic scrape of his cloth a familiar lullaby against the roar of the sea. Each dawn bled into the next, indistinguishable in their quiet predictability. He often found his gaze drifting to the horizon, not with longing, but with a dull resignation. A younger Elias might have dreamed of distant shores, but the sea had long since scoured those fancies away, leaving only the steadfast routine of lamp and brine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tonight, however, the usual monotony was broken. A faint, insistent glow drew his eye to a section of the worn floorboards near his cot, a board he’d always meant to secure but never prioritized. He’d kicked it idly countless times. Now, a soft, otherworldly light pulsed from beneath. Prying it up, Elias found not the expected damp earth, but a rolled parchment. It felt unnaturally smooth, and as he unfurled it, a startling, bioluminescent light bloomed, casting his cramped quarters in an alien glow. This was no collection of faded ink and sea-worn paper. It was an intricate, star-dusted map, alive with swirling nebulae of emerald and sapphire. Islands, unseen on any Admiralty chart, drifted across its surface. Strange constellations, beautiful and terrifyingly alien, arced overhead, mirroring a sky Elias had never known. A single, shimmering X marked a spot deep within an uncharted archipelago, humming with a silent promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elias, his heart thrumming with a sensation so foreign it felt like a forgotten limb reawakening, stared at the impossible map. The lighthouse beam, usually his sole beacon, now seemed a pathetic, flickering candle against the cosmic wonder laid bare before him. The world beyond his lonely tower had suddenly expanded, and a terrifying, exhilarating choice presented itself. The sea’s roar outside seemed to hush, as if holding its breath, awaiting his decision.\n",
